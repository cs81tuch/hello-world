Hello classmates!

Dog days' of summer are spent on learning JavaScript all over again. Though I don't see the Brightest Diamond in the night sky, my mates are basking under white sun or braving the twenty foot surfs from dawn till dusk. 
Alas, we write arcane and clipped well suited for view through the blue white windows, lest we risk lagging in the life of digital bio-dome.
